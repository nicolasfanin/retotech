# Retotech

<b>In this Repo you will find a Sample app called "RetoTech"</b>

Basically this app makes login with your phone number, then ask for a verification code and once you are logged in you will can fill a form with basics lables and create a new register in real time firebase database.

Some libraries and techinques I've used here:

- Dagger2
- Clean Architecture
- MVVM
- Navigation Component
- Live Data
- RXJava
- View Binding
- Internationalization
- Firebase auth login with phone
- Firebase real time database

The base Architecture that I've used here:

Activity / Fragment ----> View Model (LiveData) ----> Use Case ----> Repository ----> Firebase.
